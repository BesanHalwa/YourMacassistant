Barjatya's romantic family drama Maine Pyar Kiya (1989), one of India's highest-grossing films. It earned him his first nomination for a Best Actor at Filmfare, but the much expected Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut was awarded to Sooraj Barjatya.Maine Pyar Kiya was later dubbed in English as When Love Calls, a 125-minute version, which was the biggest hit in the Caribbean market at Guyana and also dominated the box office collections in Trinidad and Tobago. Maine Pyar Kiya had also been dubbed in Spanish as Te Amo, the first experiment of its kind. This 125-minute film also proved its universal appeal with a glorious 10-week premiere run at Lima, capital of Peru. In Telugu as Prema Paavuraalu, it crossed 25 weeks at Visakhapatnam and had a 100-plus day run at six centres in Andhra Pradesh. It was also dubbed in Tamil as Kaadhal Oru Kavithai and in Malayalam as Ina Praavukal.\n",

His emotional outbursts are splendid...\" Tere Naam is to date considered Salman Khan's best film with a critically acclaimed performance. He subsequently continued his success at the box office with comedies like Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004) and No Entry (2005). Khan's work in 2006 included Jaan-E-Mann and Baabul, however neither of these films were successful at the box office.\n",
